\section{Introduction}
    This document is the Hazard Analysis for StoneCap Solutions - Smart Serve. Smart Serve is an autonomous bartending robot that aims to streamline the process of a customer ordering a drink up to them receiving it. The system would automate the tasks of taking customer orders, making the drinks, and alerting the end user when the drinks are ready. This would result in a system that creates consistent, accurate and timely drinks while avoiding unnecessary spillage.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}
    The scope of this document is to conduct a Hazard Analysis on the proposed Smart Serve System using a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA). We aim to identify possible failures, their modes, effects, and causes. Knowing these, we will be able to recommend actions to mitigate these hazards.

\section{System Boundary}
    The boundary of the system will include a variety of different components that work together to create our autonomous drink creator called Smart Serve. They will consist of :
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The physical hardware that makes up the autonomous bartending system can be divided into two main sections:
        \begin {itemize}
        \item The physical frame that encapsulates the system 
        \item The computer, pumps and tubing 
        \item The drink ingredients 
        \end{itemize}
    \item The users and/or operators phone used for the web application 
    \item The web application both front and back end which is used for users and operators to interact with the system
    \item The container used to house the cocktail 
    \end{enumerate}
    All the hardware of the system excluding the WiFi network and the users phone, are the responsibility of StoneCap Solutions. All these systems work together to create the overall system boundary profile of Smart Serve for every use case. 

\section{Definition of Hazard}
As defined by Nancy Leveson's work a hazard is a condition, property or state of a system coupled with a state in the environment that has the potential to cause harm or damage. %need citation 
    
\section{Critical Assumptions}
    Critical assumptions of the system include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Smart Serve is not intentionally tampered with or physically damaged by anyone 
        %could we also say something about smart serve being in a safe area where it can't fall? 
        %Yeeeee, we could also add a bracket to the base of it where you could just add some screws to mount it to a surface pretty easily tho
        \item Smart Serve is set up on a well balanced surface that users aren't able to easily knock over
        \item All people who have access to the system are of legal drinking age 
        \item All drinking containers used with the system are made of plastic \item Internet service within the system environment is assumed to be working consistently at high-speed
        \item All containers are filled with the drink specified in the Web App
    \end{itemize}
\section{Failure Modes and Effects Analysis}
    The following is a table depicting failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) table:
    \subsection{Hazards Out of Scope}
    Hazards out of scope will include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The physical location of a bar or restaurant environment
        \item The user's mobile device to connect to the web application and works as intended
        \item Human behaviour from the result of intoxication or alcohol use 
    \end{itemize}
    
    %Maybe instead of focusing on a component, lets focus on an area like his lecture slides example, so pouring too much liquid can have a failure cause from electrical and mechanical sources.

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}
    %not really sure if we list all requirements here even if it relates to a hazard. For example ODR2 ist really related to safety and security
    \noindent
    Note: New Safety & Security Requirements not found in Version 0 are \textbf{bolded}
    \subsection{Ordering Drinks} 
    \\\\
    \noindent\textbf{ODR1:} User can scan QR code launching smart-serve web app \\\\ 
    \textbf{ODR2:} User can access the menu and select drinks to order\\\\ 
    \textbf{ODR3:} User can view place/time remaining for the drink to be made \\\\ 
    \textbf{ODR5:} User is notified if drink ingredients are out of inventory\\\\ 
    \textbf{ODR6:} User is notified when drink is done\\\\
    \textbf{ODR8:} Operator is notified if drink ingredients are out of inventory\\\\
    \textbf{ODR9:} Operator inputs all ingredients available for drinks into the web app\\\\
    \textbf{ODR10:} Operator inputs dispenser location of each ingredient into web app\\\\
    \textbf{\textbf{ODR11:} User's drink is the same drink they ordered on the app \\\\
    \textbf{ODR12:} User can login successfully into the app 
    \\\\
    \textbf{ODR13:} User has user permissions } \\\\
    \textbf{ODR14:} \textbf{Electrical components with high exposure to liquids are separated from liquid}\\\\
    \textbf{ODR15:} \textbf{Have a robust and durable architecture/components}
    
    
\section{Roadmap}
    Throughout the course of the project, the hazard analysis will be an important tool that will be used to mitigate any risks and prevent failures of design components. Although there is a possibility that not all source of risk can be or will be mitigated by our final revision, it is important that level of risk assessed is within our tolerable limits. The project will plan on implementing all safety requirements listed above given the time constraints.
