Stonecap Solutions aims to solve existing issues in the billion dollar bartending industry relating to the process of fulfilling drink orders. Bars are often busy with many orders being processed through a mental queue by bartenders. This can result in long wait times. Furthermore, many restaurants and bars are susceptible to being understaffed, further exasperating this issue. Cocktails and other drinks are imprecisely made, varying in volume and consistency. When bartenders are rushing around to make these drinks, the risk of spilling them arises. If these issues are severe enough, it could result in unsatisfied customers, decreasing business profits.
